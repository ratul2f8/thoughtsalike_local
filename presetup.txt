Follow the steps to execute local build(server)
1) install redis and start the server by running:
   -> redis-server
2) install postgresql, create a user named "hr" with password "0000"
   and create a database named "thoughtsalike" by running:
   -> sudo -u postgres createdb thoughtsalike
   or update the connection profile of /server/src/index.ts according to your configuration
3) for running migrartions in /server/src/migrartions/* folder, you have to create a user first, since we have foreign-key(user.id) as a dependency.After that replace the post.creatorId with the newely created user.id
or regenerate the migrartions through mockaroo or other tools with the command(locally)
-> yarn typeorm migrartion:generate
and move them to the /server/src/migrartions folder
****be careful in case of deleting migrations, they will be stored in /server/dist folder for the runtime****

For generating codegen types execute the command(locally)
 -> yarn gen
